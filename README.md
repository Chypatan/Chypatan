- 👋Hello, I'm Chupatan. I am not a programmer. I work in a factory and try to learn the python programming language using the Pydroid3 app on my android smartphone. Programming feels like some kind of magic to me, when sometimes amazing things come out of nothing. It's really amazing.


- 👀 I am interested in the development of mobile applications for android in the programming language python. I am also very interested in the Kotlin programming language, because it was developed by my compatriots.


- 🌱 At the moment I am learning to program on the Kivy framework and KivyMD. When I have free time at home (it's a pity that this happens rarely), I sit down at the computer and study the Kotlin programming language from the book "Head First Kotlin". I learn the Python programming language from articles on the Internet.
